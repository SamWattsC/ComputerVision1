# Hand Tracker
## Overview
- The Hand Tracker project is a real-time hand gesture recognition program developed using Python. It combines the power of the MediaPipe and OpenCV libraries to accurately track hand movements and recognize gestures. Additionally, PyAutoGUI is incorporated to simulate keyboard inputs based on detected hand gestures. The program also calculates and displays the current frames per second (FPS) for performance monitoring.

## Features
- Real-Time Hand Gesture Recognition: Utilizes the MediaPipe library to track hand movements and recognize gestures in real-time.
- Keyboard Simulation: Integrates PyAutoGUI to simulate keyboard inputs based on the detected hand gestures, enabling interaction with applications through hand gestures.
- FPS Monitoring: Calculates and displays the current frames per second (FPS) to monitor the performance of the program.
## Technologies Used
- Python: The programming language used for developing the application.
- MediaPipe: A library by Google Research for building real-time multi-modal ML pipelines.
- OpenCV: An open-source computer vision and machine learning software library.
- PyAutoGUI: A cross-platform GUI automation Python module for simulating mouse and keyboard actions.
